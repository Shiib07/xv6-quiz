Answer 12: Process States
In the XV6 operating system, a process can be in several states:

UNUSED: The process is not yet created.
EMBRYO: The process is in the creation stage.
SLEEPING: The process is waiting for a resource or an event.
RUNNABLE: The process is ready to run and is waiting for the CPU time for its execution.
RUNNING: The process is currently being executed by the CPU.
ZOMBIE: The process has been terminated but its exit status has not yet been collected by its parent process.

Answer 13: File System Structure
Superblock: It contains metadata about the file system.
Inodes: Represents files and directories, storing their metadata.
Block 0: It is unused and left available for use by the operating system boot sequence.

Answer 14: System Calls vs. Library Functions
System Calls: Interfaces to the kernel providing services like file manipulation, process control, etc. (e.g., fork(), exec()).
Library Functions: Built on top of system calls, residing in user space, providing higher-level functionality (e.g., printf(), scanf()).


Answer 15: Memory Paging
In XV6, memory paging is used to manage memory allocations. The benefits of using paging in memory management include easier memory management, protection of memory spaces, and efficient use of memory.

Answer 16: Shell Commands
ls: Lists the files in the current directory.
echo: Outputs the strings it is being passed as arguments.
cd: Changes the current directory to the one specified as argument.

Answer 17: Process Synchronization
It ensures that processesâ€™ execution is carried out in a way that the integrity of the data is maintained. The mechanisms used to achieve process synchronization in XV6 include locks and semaphores.

Answer 18: Interrupt Handling
Interrupts in the XV6 operating system play a crucial role in managing the execution of processes.

Answer 19: Virtual Memory
In XV6, there is no concept of virtual memory as it does not do demand paging. All valid pages of a process are always allocated physical pages. However, XV6 uses 32-bit virtual addresses, resulting in a virtual address space of 4GB.


Answer 20: Boot Process of XV6:
BIOS/UEFI: Performs Power-On Self Test (POST).
Bootloader (e.g., GRUB): Loads the kernel into memory.
Kernel Initialization: Sets up essential data structures, starts scheduler, and initializes devices.
User Space Initialization: Launches the first user-space process.
